This project has been developed to learn how to configure my own Docker
environment for Odoo. There are alternatives such as
[odoocker/odoocker](https://github.com/odoocker/odoocker) or
[andyengit/odooinstance](https://github.com/andyengit/odooinstance), which I have used as
references (even for the name). However, this project has been developed to
learn "from scratch".
