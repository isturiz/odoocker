# Docker for Odoo Development

## CLI

This project provides scripts that are often useful when working with Odoo.

There are two ways to use the CLI:

1. Relative path: Execute the script directly using `./odoocker --help`.
2. Add to PATH: To add it to your system PATH, run `./odoocker install_cli`.

This project has been developed as a learning exercise to configure my own
Docker environment for Odoo.

There are alternatives such as
[odoocker/odoocker](https://github.com/odoocker/odoocker) or
[andyengit/odooinstance](https://github.com/andyengit/odooinstance), which I
have used as references (even for the name). However, this project has been
developed to learn "from scratch".
